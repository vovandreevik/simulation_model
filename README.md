# Simulation Model

## Overview
This project is a simulation model of a queuing system with request sources, devices, and a buffer. The model operates in two modes: step-by-step and automatic. It provides visualizations of simulation results, including statistics on device utilization and rejection probabilities.

## Features
- Request generation based on Poisson distribution
- Request processing with uniform service time
- Buffering and request rejection handling
- Two operation modes: step-by-step and automatic
- Real-time visualization of simulation results

## Technologies Used
- **Frontend**: React, TypeScript
- **Build Tool**: Vite
